# KIDS

The kidney intelligent diagnosis system (KIDS) was developed to implement comprehensive management in chronic kidney disease using fundus images, including detecting CKD in populations, conducting pathological diagnosis and staging in identified CKD patients, and predicting disease prognosis on the basis of the pathological diagnosis. This system has the potential to improve clinical management of patients with CKD, particularly those who are ineligible for renal biopsies.
